                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I am a fourth year Computing Science student at the University of Alberta. My favourite hobbies outside of work are video games and sports. I spend a lot of time sitting at my computer, so I find it important to keep active as much as possible. My favourite games are MMO and FPS titles. I love playing soccer and hockey, depending on what season it is of course! I'm a competitive person, and I take that into the projects I work on to create the best results I can.
