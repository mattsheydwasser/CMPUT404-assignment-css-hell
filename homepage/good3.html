                        <p>
                            I am a fourth year Computing Science student at the University of Alberta. Some of my favourite hobbies include video games and sports. <br><br>I spend a lot of time sitting at my computer, so I find it important to keep active as much as possible. My favourite games are MMO and FPS titles. I love playing soccer and hockey, depending on what season it is of course! <br><br>I'm a competitive person, and I always need to perform to the best of my ability. I take this into the projects I work on to create the best results I can.
