                        <h1>About Me</h1>
                        <p>
                            I am a fourth year Computing Science student at the University of Alberta. I have three siblings; an older brother, a twin sister, and a baby sister. Some of my hobbies include soccer, hockey, and games <br><br>My baby sister is a big part of my life. She is a large inspiration for me to work hard and accomplish my goals so I can be a good role model for her.

                        <p>
                            I have worked on a few large projects in a group setting. <br><br>These includes working on a software engineering team to create a website for a client (using JavaScript, React, and Postgres with docker), as well as creating an Android application, both as term projects.

                            Experience with multiple popular languages, such as Python, C, Java, Javascript, HTML/CSS.<br><br>
                            Another skill I believe to be valuable is my ability to work well in a group environment and stand out as a leader when needed.
